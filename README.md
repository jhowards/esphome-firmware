<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
The Satellite1 ESPHome firmware should be flashed on your [FutureProofHomes Core Board](https://futureproofhomes.net/products/satellite1-core-board). For flashing instructions please visit [Docs.FutureProofHomes.net](https://docs.futureproofhomes.net).  After the firmware is successfully flashed and your Core Board is connected to your Wifi it will appear in your Home Assistant as a new device called "Satellite1".

## Key Features of the Firmware
- [ ] Works with the Home Assistant Platform so you can control your home.
- [ ] Optionally connect the Satellite1 to [Local AI Ollama](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ollama/) or [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversation/) to chat with an  AI and control your home.  Do this at your own risk.
- [ ] This firmware enables your FutureProofHomes Core Board to mount with our [HAT board](https://futureproofhomes.net/products/satellite1-top-microphone-board) which then unlocks:
- [ ] On-Demand flashing of our open source XMOS firmware for audio echo cancellation and other audio processing algorithms.
- [ ] [On-Device WakeWord support.](https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord)
- [ ] Temperature/Humidity/Light sensor readings of the room
- [ ] Attachable mmWave Radar for Human Presence Detection
- [ ] Music streaming via HA Media Browser or [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/)
- [ ] Volume Up/Down & Action Buttons
- [ ] Hardware & Software Mute Buttons
- [ ] 360 degree LEDs & Notification Animations
- [ ] Support for TTS Announcements via Home Assistant
- [ ] USB-C Power Delivery for easy power input
- [ ] GPIO expansion ports for to quickly add accessories like speakers, sensors, radios, amplifiers, etc.
- [ ] (COMING SOON) Bluetooth Room Presense Detection (currently this feature is crashing)

## Why Open Source?
We believe it is irresponsible to ask customers to trust that our microphone and AI in-a-box protects your privacy.  To hold ourselves and the whole world accountable it is prudent to open-source our work so that we can all benefit from this amazing technology.  Let's build together.

## Why Purchase from FutureProofHomes?
Put simply, your purchase helps fund our team and further innovation.  Also, the FutureProofHomes team will work hard to give you top-quality products that are tested, fully-functional, in stock (as often as possible) and lead with great community support.  You can purchase Satellite1 components individually, or purchase the entire devkit as a package.  Help us, help you!

## Developing, Testing & Debugging
Create/activate environment by running from project root:
```bash
source scripts/setup_build_env.sh
```

Build firmware on your local machine:
```bash
esphome compile config/satellite1.yaml
```

Upload firmware to your Core Board:
```bash
esphome upload config/satellite1.yaml
```

Connect the device to your wifi network:
1. Go to: [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io)
2. Click on "Connect" and select the correct JTAG/serial debug unit
3. Click on the three dots and select 'Configure WiFi'

Tail the Core Board's Logs:
1. Go to: [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io) and connect then click logs... or
2. Tail the ESPHome logs of the Core Board's running firmware from the command line:
```bash
esphome logs config/satellite1.yaml
```

## Home Assistant Voice Assistant Debugging

1. [Set up you local pipeline](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant/)
2. [Troubleshoot your pipeline](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/troubleshooting/)
